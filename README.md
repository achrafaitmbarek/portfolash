# Portfolio Achraf Ait MK

Welcome to the repository of my personal portfolio. This portfolio is designed to showcase my skills, projects, and professional journey. Inspired by another design whose name I can't recall (a common situation!), this project is built with React, HTML, CSS, and Material-UI.

## About the Portfolio

My portfolio is a showcase of my web development skills. It features my recent projects, professional experiences, and provides an overview of who I am as a developer.

## Key Features

- **Home**: A quick introduction with an overview of my skills, a brief presentation of myself, and links to my social media.
- **About Me**: A page styled like a terminal with an elegant interface where I introduce myself, detail my skills and projects, inspired by another design whose name I can't remember.
- **Portfolio**: A gallery of projects I've worked on, with detailed descriptions and links to GitHub repositories or live demos.
